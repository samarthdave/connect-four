# Connect :four:
#### implemented in Java

My goals for this project
- refactor for clarity and structure
  - as it is, a "ConnectFourFrame" controls the state of the game
  - I should extract the game feature into it's own class (or find a version online...)

- create a Connect4 "AI" using minimax algorithm
  - and not random like I am atm
